        <p class="test1">Hey there. This game has been in the making for a while and god it was HARD. The amount of bugs and everything ugh it was never ending. But alls well now (hopefully). I mean i dont even know if ill even be able to finish this to the original scope that i had planned for it but i gues we'll see. I still havent come up with a name for this and i dont know if ill even be able to lmao. uh, i dont know if you've read what ive written but here it is just in case you havent or you wanna see it again https://codepen.io/urmeankanha/full/pvobvLq. I put in an insane amount of work in this and i hope the quality shows for itself. Theres also a few tracks that, not made specefically for this, did suit the game well. so theres that. i dont wanna spoil much of the game, but im sure you'll like it. kinda wanted to replicate the DTI wala feel, but i guess it just turned out to be its own thing. It has a lotta options, a lot of customisations and ill probably add more to it as time goes on, but this is a good first release. The music can be stopped, skipped, paused and allat. Theres even an option to save the outfits that you made. Unless there isnt and i forgot to make it. in that case forget what i said. IF youre still reading this, thanks for downloading the game first of all, and secondly go crazy. Theres a ton (not exactly) of stuff to do and it should your monkey brain entertained for a good afternoon. All that being said, i hope you enjoy playing this as much as i enjoyed making this for you. Love you <3 </p>
