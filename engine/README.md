# UDUG-game
 Browser based game.
This game/proof of concept is made purely using vanilla HTML CSS AND JS. While made for a different purpose, it serves its purpose as good proof that not all browser based games require a game engine. While being limited in options and scope, it's variation and style hopefully makes up for it.
